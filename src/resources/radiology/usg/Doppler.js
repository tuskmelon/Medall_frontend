You will lie on an examination table on your back or side, depending on the specific area to be examined. Ultrasound gel is applied on the area of the body that will undergo the examination. The transducer sends painless sound waves through your skin into your body. The sound waves are high frequency and you wonâ€™t hear them.The sound waves reflect off the moving blood cells, causing the pitch of the sound waves to change. You may hear a whooshing sound from the ultrasound machine. The transducer detects changes in the sound wave. A machine records the sound wave changes and converts them into images or graphs for your doctor to review."
