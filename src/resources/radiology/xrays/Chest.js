You will stand against a photographic plate and the radiographer, the health professional who takes the X-rays, will ask you to take a deep breath and hold it (this helps to improve the quality of the X-ray image). Once they have taken the X-ray, they will advise you to breathe normally again. You may have chest X-rays taken from different angles, but they only take a few seconds each time and the whole process usually takes a few minutes. The radiographer will check the images before you leave and advise you when the results will be available to you. "
